            <p>
                The majority of the initial set of Genome Properties were produced within the TIGRFAM project, and
                refer to predominantly prokaryotic genomes. In parallel with the integration of Genome Properties
                into InterPro, further (predominantly eukaryotic) properties were produced by the InterPro group,
                and have been added to the total set. We welcome collaboration with any groups with an interest in
                defining further Genome Properties based on their own area of interest/expertise.</p>
            <p>If you would like to contribute to Genome Properties in this way, please contact us at:</p>
